# Real-time GPX Route Generator

Simple web application that lets you type in a starting location, ending location, amount of time to pass, and number of steps, and generates a GPX file that contains all of the points of travel, and the correct times they would be reached for that distance.

Just replace `<YOUR API KEY HERE>` with your Google Maps geocode/javascript map API enabled key.
